our $LIST = {
    summary => 'Modules with good interfaces',
    description => <<'_',

This is my subjective list of modules that I think have particularly nice
interfaces (APIs) and are convenient to use. Modules that are a delight to use
(in Marie Kondo lingo: "spark joy") and remind you why you love Perl and
programming in general.
